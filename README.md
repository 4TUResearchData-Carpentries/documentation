# Documentation

This repository contains the documentation about Carpentry workshops, their organization and the content of the lessons. 

We document here: 
- how to create a Carpentry website
- changes we make to the lectures 
- any other related information that could be of use when organizing or teaching at a Carpentry workshop: for example troubleshooting tips!

We hope this might be of use to us all!
