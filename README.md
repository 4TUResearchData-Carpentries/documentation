# Documentation

This repository contains the documentation about Carpentry workshop, their organization and the content of the lessons. 

We document here: 
- how to create a carpentry website
- changes we make to the lectures 
- any other related information that could be of use when organizing or teaching at a Carpentry workshop.


We hope this might be of use to us all!
