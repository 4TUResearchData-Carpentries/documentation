# Hello there :D

This folder is to document frequent issues that students, helpers and instructors may face during the installation of the required software for the workshops.

If you have find a new problem, please document it ! using one markdown document per issue will be optimal with a proper title indicating what is it about.

- In case you know the solution , great! you can also add that in the document, otherwise , open an issue in Github with the problem you face , and then we would 
look for the solution and document it :)
