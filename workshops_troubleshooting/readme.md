# Hello there :D

This folder is to document frequent issues that students, helpers and instructors may face during the installation of the software required for the workshops.

If you encounter a new problem, **please document it**! Using one markdown document per issue will be ideal, with a proper title indicating what it is about.

- In case you know the solution, great! You can also add that in the document. Otherwise open an issue in Github with the problem you face and, then, we look for the solution and document it :) 

Also, look up the official Carpentry resources to import, integrate, rebutt troubleshooting tips:
